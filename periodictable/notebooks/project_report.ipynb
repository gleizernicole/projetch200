    "Invented by Mendeleev in 1871, the periodic table is an indispensable tool for any person who wishes to adventure itself along the arduous path of becoming a chemist. Indeed, this tabular array of the chemical elements contained in the universe is organized by increasing atomic number and has been of inestimable value in the development of chemistry.\n",

Different orbitals exist such as the s orbital, p orbital, d orbital, and f orbital which refer to orbitals with angular momentum quantum number ℓ = 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively. As they all have different shapes and should be represented in 3D, we decided to use ``numpy``which is a python packaged used for fast mathematical operations over arrays in order to calculate the structure of the orbitals. The structure were then saved using `matplotlib.pyplot` as a Portable Network Graphic (PNG), which is useful as it can handle transparent backgrounds, and then were transfered into a generated output directory, unique to each element.
